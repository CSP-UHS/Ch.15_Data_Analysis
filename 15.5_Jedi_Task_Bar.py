Create your Bar Chart
----------------------
You will need to determine how to do a horizontal bar chart. 
First make 13 red and white horizontal bars with a height of 1. 
(width has now become height since we are using horizontal bars) 
Use xticks and yticks to put 13 asterisks as the labels on the x and y axes. 
Make a single blue horizontal bar. 
Use Stars as the vertical label and Stripes as the horizontal label. 
Change the title of your flag to include your name. 
To get rid of whitespace on the top and right edges use plt.autoscale(tight='yes')

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


























plt.show()

Create your Histogram
----------------------
Hint: You will again need to import the numpy library and determine the mean and standard deviation
of the data. You can do this like:

average = np.mean(dataset)
standev = np.std(dataset)

You will create vertical lines at the mean, at +2 standard deviations above the mean 
and -2 standard deviations below the mean. To create a vertical line, research (axvline).

Incorporate the mean and standard deviation into the title. The Greek letters (mu) and (sigma) stand 
for mean and standard deviation respectively. Research how to get those Greek letters (Math Text)
into the title.

Here is the data that needs to be used:
ages = [22,55,62,45,21,22,34,42,42,4,99,102,110,120,
        121,122,130,111,115,112,80,75,65,54,44,43,42,48,170]
        
You need to determine your bins.
